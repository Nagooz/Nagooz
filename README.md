## 🚀 Projects I've Worked On

### [scRNA-seq analysis - Migratory ASC Subpopulation Analysis]
Developed advanced bioinformatics approaches to identify and characterize a subpopulation of migratory **Adipose Stem Cells (ASCs)** during **muscle regeneration**. This project focused on determining the regulatory factors of ASC activation and migration and proposing actionable biomarkers for applied research.

- Processed and analyzed **30,000+ cells** and **20,000+ genes** per sample across **3 organs** and **3 experimental conditions**.
- Used **machine learning methods** such as **dimensionality reduction (PCA, UMAP)** and **unsupervised clustering (KNN)** to structure large scRNA-seq datasets.
- Reconstructed **cellular trajectories** using **PAGA Tree** and **Palantir**, and modeled velocity with **Velocyto** to infer ASC migratory dynamics.
- Integrated **CellChat** and **Nichenet** to infer intercellular communication networks and identify the cell type driving ASC activation.
- Built a **supervised classification model** (logistic regression, random forest, **XGBoost**) to classify ASCs within **FAPs** with **80% recall** despite an imbalanced dataset (2% ASCs).
- Projected experimental data onto a **human adipose tissue atlas** to enhance the transferability of results across species.

### [HPC-Optimized SCENIC Pipeline for Gene Regulatory Network Prediction]
Developed a scalable **Nextflow pipeline** on **HPC** (High-Performance Computing) environments that do not provide access to containers (e.g., **Docker**) for implementation of **SCENIC** to predict key **gene regulatory networks**
